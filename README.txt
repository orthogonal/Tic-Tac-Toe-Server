An implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe server.  I am building this to refresh my memory of how PHP works and gain a better understanding of Pusher for future projects.  I am also designing some authentication systems from scratch to ensure that players stay within their own games and see each other's moves, which will be interesting.  I am also planning on implementing a live scoreboard of the top players, number of games played, and statistics from those games.
